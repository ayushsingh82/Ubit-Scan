# UbitScan

## Introduction

UbitScan is a tool designed to simplify the tracking of transactions and balances within the ubit domain. Tracking transactions and balances through the ubit domain can be challenging, so UbitScan aims to provide a one-stop solution for tracking addresses, balances, internal transactions, and external transactions. We have connected .eth to .ubit through ICNS (Interchain naming system) https://app.icns.xyz/


## Features





- **Address Tracking**: Easily track addresses within the ubit domain.
- **Balance Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the balance of addresses.
- **Internal Transaction Tracking**: Monitor internal transactions within the ubit domain.
- **External Transaction Tracking**: Track external transactions involving ubit domain addresses.
- **Comprehensive Portfolio Overview**: UbitScan provides a comprehensive overview of your UBIT domain portfolio, including detailed information such as time, hash, and more.
- **Future Development**: The future goal of UbitScan is to evolve into a complete portfolio tracker for UBIT. This will include additional features such as portfolio performance analysis, asset allocation insights, and customizable reporting.

## How It Works

UbitScan utilizes the .ubit domain to access and track transactions and balances within the UBIT ecosystem. By leveraging this domain, UbitScan can provide users with real-time insights into their ubit domain activities.
